# Network & Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of resources and implementations for various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), designed to safeguard your networks and individual hosts from malicious activities.
What's Inside?

### This project explores and offers practical examples of both network and host-centric IDS approaches:

### Network-based IDS (NIDS):

    Dive into systems that meticulously monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and anomalies. Learn how to detect threats at the network perimeter.

### Host-based IDS (HIDS):

    Explore techniques for monitoring individual systems, analyzing system logs, file changes, and other host-specific activities to uncover potential compromises.

### Signature-based IDS: 

    Understand and implement IDS that identify threats based on predefined attack patterns, signatures, and known vulnerabilities, whether deployed on the network or a host.

### Anomaly-based IDS: 

    Discover how to leverage heuristics and machine learning algorithms to detect unusual and potentially malicious behavior that deviates from a learned "normal" baseline. These systems are trained on previously observed attack patterns to identify       novel threats.

 Whether you're looking to understand the fundamentals or implement practical IDS solutions, this repository aims to be a valuable resource.
